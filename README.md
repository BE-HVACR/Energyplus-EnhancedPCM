# Energyplus-EnhancedPCM
This is a repository based on NREL's Energyplus with enhanced PCM hysteresis model

## Brief introduction
The PCM hysteresis model in this revised EnergyPlus employs a two-phase hysteresis method, and this is expected to enhance 
the model's capability to simulate partial phase change process, especially for industry-grade PCM products.
